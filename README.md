# README #

A page for gathering and working with interesting planetary data with the end-goal of acquiring interesting data for folks who aren't well-versed in planetary and orbital science. Created primarily because I wanted a page where I could get data easily without having to constantly do math.

### Status ###

* Entering a radius returns a list of other values that can be calculated from the radius.
* Entering mass will return the force of gravity in m/s^2 as well as the Earth-relative g-force.
* Shows distance to the other major bodies in the solar system. Polls this data on page-load.

### To-do List ###

* Create a "slide mode" to rotate through slides with interesting data (for display purposes)
* Add a slider for "radius"?
* Add buttons for each planet measurement field to auto-fill that field with the value for a specific planet
* Find more APIs with interesting data (solar data, satellite data, etc)
* Sort planet results by solar-system order (MVEmMJSUNp)

### Setup ###

* Uses javascript/jQuery/html/css - no server required
* Relies on http://www.astro-phys.com for planetary location data
